/* This is the place to define your Web Map as a JSON object, if you do not want to do it in ArcGIS Online.
 See the following links for help and examples on defining a Web Map:
 http://resources.arcgis.com/en/help/arcgis-web-map-json/
 http://help.arcgis.com/en/webapi/javascript/arcgis/jshelp/#intro_webmap

***
 To enable the ability for users to save or share their map, generate a GUID for the webmap and specify as an "id" property in the main JSON object
    Can use this website to generate a GUID- http://www.guidgenerator.com/online-guid-generator.aspx
